# DSAcollection_COOP
This is the project for the implementation of the algorithms and data structures. The code base is built according to the authors' view on the OO and the @yegor256 view on the OO.

[![Hits-of-Code](https://hitsofcode.com/github/CatOrLeader/DSAcollection_COOP?branch=main)](https://hitsofcode.com/github/CatOrLeader/DSAcollection_COOP/view?branch=main)

Already refactored:

### Algorithms

- All the basic sortings

### Data Structures

- Stack (all types)
- Maps (Separate Chaining, Linear Probing, Double Hashing)
- Based on MapADT DS (Dictionary, LinkedHashMap, SkipList, TreeMap, Trie)
- Graphs (all types)
- Heaps (Binary, Binomial, D, Leftist, Pairing, SKew, Ternary)
